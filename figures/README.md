This directory contains the figures that compare the results of jim and bilby for the GWTC-2.1 and GWTC-3 events.
Blue lines are jim results and red lines are bilby results.
The figures are generated by `plot.py`.
Currently, the priors and the waveform approximants are slightly different between jim and bilby.
The figures are generated for the following parameters:
- chirp mass
- mass ratio
- luminosity distance
- inclination
- right ascension
- declination
- polarization angle
- phase
